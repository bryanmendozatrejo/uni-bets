• A website design for play-betting on your favorite sports teams with a login system to save your current credits.

• To save your current information, this website utilizes Firebase’s authentication system with an email and password approach kept on the cloud.

• The betting cards with various categories are created dynamically with JavaScript utilizing DOM queries to populate the appropriate number of betting cards. 

• To create a more realistic feel, we created a simulation of games where the user only forty-five seconds to bet. Once the game ends, the bets are tallied and reflected onto the website and firebase database
